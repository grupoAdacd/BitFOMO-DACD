I am a newbie here and trying to learn more about the coins. I recently learnt about scam coins and their working mechanism. The thing I don't understand is can you sell your coin at any time? If yes, why cant you buy these coins at its lowest and make profit when they are pumped? I know if it was like that everyone would become rich but I still dont understand. For example, if I buy 10 coins at 0,05 dollars and sell it from 1 dollar, I would still make a huge profit. Thanks to anyone who makes this topic clear for me. "}
