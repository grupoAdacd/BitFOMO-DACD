What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

Seed phrases get lost or stolen. People get scammed every day. Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

Seed phrases get lost or stolen. People get scammed every day. Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price.

The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb.

The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

Meanwhile I had to sell off an M3 MacBook Pro to pay debts and I'm using a 2014 MacBook Air to try and stay alive but I still owe so much. \n\nNo one can take your crypto, it is YOURS!\n\nI want to build my life back up that way, I want to hear about software jobs that pay in crypto. I even thought of doing a website where people pay $1 in crypto to get a space (like the million dollar site). I don't know if anyone gives a shit though.\n\nPoint is, F-K fiat!\n\n. \n \n\n","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747067887.000000000}

Seed phrases get lost or stolen. People get scammed every day. Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price.

The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath.

If you hate your boss, you should love Bitcoin. \n\nIf you love free markets and meritocracy, you should love Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a free market superior money that cannot be stopped. \n\nThe debt based, consumer based, capitalist/industrialist based society we currently live in is irrational beyond all belief. \n\nBitcoin will greatly rationalise the world, and act as a rational anchor on every person, business and government's decision.\n\nThe most pernicious thing about Fiat is that it distorts free markets due to arbitrary money printing and distribution of this money.\n\nBitcoin will strip power from incompetent Governments and give it back to free markets.\n\nI'm annoyed i didn't learn all this ten years ago, but a chance at financial independence remains. \n\nI wish you all luck.  \n","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747051417.000000000}

Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players.

Seed phrases get lost or stolen. People get scammed every day. Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price.

The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

It probably is only at around 0.5% adoption rate at the moment so a LOT of upside remains. \n\nIt is volatile and the adoption will take time so there will be buying opportunities. \n\nBitcoin is hard to improve on so a superior coin is extremely unlikely to come into being. \n\nBitcoin works so well it seems like more of a discovery than an invention. \n\nIt will completely re-shape Fiat financed financial markets and the financial industry as a whole. \n\nIt is a generational opportunity to become more financially independent. If you hate your boss, you should love Bitcoin. \n\nIf you love free markets and meritocracy, you should love Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a free market superior money that cannot be stopped. \n\nThe debt based, consumer based, capitalist/industrialist based society we currently live in is irrational beyond all belief. \n\nBitcoin will greatly rationalise the world, and act as a rational anchor on every person, business and government's decision.\n\nThe most pernicious thing about Fiat is that it distorts free markets due to arbitrary money printing and distribution of this money.\n\nBitcoin will strip power from incompetent Governments and give it back to free markets.\n\nI'm annoyed i didn't learn all this ten years ago, but a chance at financial independence remains. \n\nI wish you all luck.  \n","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747051417.000000000}

Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

Seed phrases get lost or stolen. People get scammed every day. Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price.

The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

Meanwhile I had to sell off an M3 MacBook Pro to pay debts and I'm using a 2014 MacBook Air to try and stay alive but I still owe so much. \n\nNo one can take your crypto, it is YOURS!\n\nI want to build my life back up that way, I want to hear about software jobs that pay in crypto. I even thought of doing a website where people pay $1 in crypto to get a space (like the million dollar site).

According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price.

The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols.

Seed phrases get lost or stolen. People get scammed every day. Even ‚Äúsecure‚Äù hardware wallets have a single point of failure: the seed phrase.\n\nGridlock doesn‚Äôt have any of these problems.\n\n\n\n# What is Gridlock?\n\nGridlock is a free and open source storage technology that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).¬†\n\nThose are big words, but here‚Äôs what they mean: your crypto gets split across multiple devices so there‚Äôs no single point of failure‚Äîno seed phrase, no easy way to get hacked.\n\nYou build your own grid of devices that lock your crypto.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different way of storing crypto, but you get something way better: real security, plus third-party protection and social recovery built in for free.\n\n\\- - -¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy trust some random dude?‚Äù\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt trust me. Don‚Äôt trust anyone. Definitely not exchanges that hold full control over your crypto. Good thing Gridlock is open source. You can run your own MPC storage network with full self-custody and full control.\n\nDon‚Äôt want to bother running code from a GitHub repo?

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747028815.000000000}

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get.

What do you think?","selftext":"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth ‚Äî a sort of monetary ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù\n\nThis hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more ‚Äúrescue‚Äù USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.\n\nSince April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.\nPost yes one on reddit and true?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747054802.000000000}

Fiat currency is a dystopian nightmare, imagine someone you've never met being allowed to with hold your money and leave you destitute just because they feel like it and they won't say why. Meanwhile I had to sell off an M3 MacBook Pro to pay debts and I'm using a 2014 MacBook Air to try and stay alive but I still owe so much. \n\nNo one can take your crypto, it is YOURS!\n\nI want to build my life back up that way, I want to hear about software jobs that pay in crypto. I even thought of doing a website where people pay $1 in crypto to get a space (like the million dollar site). I don't know if anyone gives a shit though.\n\nPoint is, F-K fiat!\n\n. \n \n\n","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747067887.000000000}

According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price.

The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.\n\nIn short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players.

Regardless of what you think about Richard Heart--this was a complete and total win for true DeFi. \n\nFor anyone that is actually into DeFi and is still under the illusion that HEX is a scam or a ponzi or that somehow Richard has been secretly simultaneously propping up the prices and dumping on everyone....DYOR by reading the actual court docs on Courtlistener. \n\nYou don't even have to trust me on this, you can trust the legal documents that led to the one and only complete loss for the SEC. If that's not enough to tell you that what you've been conditioned into hating has less to it than you might have though, read the HEX contract itself on Etherescan. \n\nThe reason why HEX is so good is because it is a cybersecurity-first smart contract, completely self-custodial staking, and can operate independently of its creator. Should Richard become absent like he was during the whole SEC case, or even die....the HEX code continues, and if anything becomes stronger. \n\nIt was so massively gatekept that Uniswap exposed how non-DeFi it truly was by blocking it on the front end (though you could still use Uni the smart contract, e.g., they made a business decision that impacted people and can do it again you guys). Metamask on mobile went friggen crazy because of all this, and not only prevented hex but now they block all but ETH I think? CoinMarketCap had HEX permanently pinned at #201 during its entire launch phase because (like many here on r/cc still) thought they knew best for everyone else....and then went on to promote ***literal scams*** ***and frauds and guys this is all your money..*****.**\n\nI implore you. Stop giving your energy and tokens to centralized exchanges, or to third parties, and take custody of your assets. Stop letting the weird narratives on Richard / HEX continue and just accept the olive branch or at the very least acknowledge how it has benefited your beloved projects, because again, this was THE biggest crypto case we're ever going to get. If the SEC won here, it would have been an unbelievable bloodbath. As it is right now, it's only a slight bloodbath because the actual scams are still going on &amp; the narrative is whack. \n\nWhen will people wake up?","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747025027.000000000}

As I‚Äôm new i just wanna start small to get used to it, I‚Äôm currently using Crypto.com. If I had to put 100GBP into a market to gain a quick return and broaden my understanding of the market, what would you recommend? Many thanks ","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747045135.000000000}

Or do you think things are going to go up even more. I‚Äôm up 50% on some coins and I don‚Äôt want to ride it all the way down but I also want to maximize profits.

Anyone else over it?","selftext":"I try to find useful resources and professionals who actually elevate crypto, but this guy is so hard to stomach. He‚Äôs a man child with constant ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù energy, always acting like he got it right‚Ä¶ but he never actually says anything.\n\nHe just said, ‚ÄúSee, this was the time to buy the bottom‚Äù, after the bottom had already happened. Not once did he say ‚Äúbuy here‚Äù or ‚Äúaccumulate now.‚Äù He gives two opposite answers every time and tries to act like he knew it all along.\n\nHis videos are dragged out just to make ad money. I‚Äôve tried listening to him because occasionally there‚Äôs something useful, but it‚Äôs usually buried under 30 minutes of rambling that could‚Äôve been said in 3 seconds.\n\nIt honestly feels like listening to a 12-year-old with zero social skills and zero friends try to sound deep about crypto. And now he‚Äôs lying in retrospect about his calls. He literally said there‚Äôd be a setback‚Ä¶ and then BTC ripped to $105K and ETH pumped‚Äîand suddenly his stance changed.\n\nWhat happened to altseason all year? What happened to ETH lagging? Now it‚Äôs ‚ÄúETH might follow BTC this time‚Äù? Come on.\n\nCrypto deserves better. If anyone knows someone else worth watching, drop a name. I know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way, I just can‚Äôt believe people buy into these non-answers and constant hindsight spin.","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1747009962.000000000}
