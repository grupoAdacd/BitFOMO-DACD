Many argue these patterns are meaningless since stock prices are driven purely by buying and selling. However, if nearly all retail traders study these charts and recognize a specific pattern‚Äîlike a bullish one‚Äîwhat happens? Everyone starts buying the asset, driving the price up. In a pseudo-way, the pattern becomes \"correct,\" not because it‚Äôs inherently valid, but because collective trader behavior makes it self-fulfilling. Thoughts on this paradox? Do patterns work only because we believe they do?\n\nEdit:\nHi, thanks for chiming in! I totally get that technical analysis (TA) involves more than just this one angle, and I'd love to hear your take on why you think TA works.\n\n My point in the post was to highlight one specific aspect: the self-fulfilling prophecy created by collective trader behavior.When a large number of traders recognize a popular pattern‚Äîlike a bullish flag or a double bottom‚Äîand act on it by buying, their combined actions can drive the price up, making the pattern appear \"correct.\" This doesn‚Äôt mean patterns are inherently predictive or based on some universal market law, but rather that they can work because enough people believe in them and act accordingly. It‚Äôs like a feedback loop driven by mass psychology, not necessarily by fundamentals or even the pattern‚Äôs design.\n\nOf course, TA also includes tools like support/resistance, indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.), and volume analysis, which traders use to interpret market dynamics. But I think the crowd effect is a big reason why certain patterns gain traction, especially in heavily traded assets. Curious to know what you think TA‚Äôs core mechanism is, or if you see this crowd-driven effect as separate from how TA functions. What‚Äôs your perspective?\n\nEdit2: I have used ai to correct my grammatical mistakes.","sentimentScore":-0.14705882352941177,"timestamp":1746803854.000000000}

It's not about being right every time, it's about managing risk effectively.\n- Don't hesitate to cut a loss. Holding on to a losing position in hopes of a turnaround will often lead to bigger losses.\n- Use stop-loss orders. This ensures you exit a losing trade at a predetermined price, limiting your losses.\n\nIn my workflow, I use a mix of tools to help me stay objective. TradingView for charting, some basic indicators, and lately, I've been testing out AIQuant for pattern recognition.
