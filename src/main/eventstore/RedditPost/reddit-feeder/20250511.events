Forward guidance is very negative with most economist saying a recession is basically unavoidable if we aren't already in one.

Many publicly traded companies have given forward warnings about future quarterly reports.\n\nWhat's next for Crypto?\n\nSame pattern seems to be holding true. If US stocks are heading for a hard dip second half of this year into 2026, then crypto is going with it. Some wonder if BTC will hold this time, as the digital gold rumored asset class? It's a bet that has yet to come true.\n\nCan crypto run into a new bull trend?\n\nIt's unlikely. Future stock declines seem to be a certain which means crypto will follow.\n\nNonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months. A handful of breaks above 110k with retreats below isn't bullish, it's bearish.

Does it hold and rally some into summer.\n\nIt did hold around the low 75k level.\n\nUS economics hasn't changed. Forward guidance is very negative with most economist saying a recession is basically unavoidable if we aren't already in one. The question has moved onto wondering how deep of a recession we'll have. It's more than tariffs, it's consumer expectations are at extreme lows which means consumer spending has been pulling back. Many publicly traded companies have given forward warnings about future quarterly reports.\n\nWhat's next for Crypto?\n\nSame pattern seems to be holding true. If US stocks are heading for a hard dip second half of this year into 2026, then crypto is going with it. Some wonder if BTC will hold this time, as the digital gold rumored asset class? It's a bet that has yet to come true.\n\nCan crypto run into a new bull trend?\n\nIt's unlikely. Future stock declines seem to be a certain which means crypto will follow.\n\nNonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months. A handful of breaks above 110k with retreats below isn't bullish, it's bearish.

Does it hold and rally some into summer.\n\nIt did hold around the low 75k level.\n\nUS economics hasn't changed. Forward guidance is very negative with most economist saying a recession is basically unavoidable if we aren't already in one. The question has moved onto wondering how deep of a recession we'll have. It's more than tariffs, it's consumer expectations are at extreme lows which means consumer spending has been pulling back. Many publicly traded companies have given forward warnings about future quarterly reports.\n\nWhat's next for Crypto?\n\nSame pattern seems to be holding true. If US stocks are heading for a hard dip second half of this year into 2026, then crypto is going with it. Some wonder if BTC will hold this time, as the digital gold rumored asset class? It's a bet that has yet to come true.\n\nCan crypto run into a new bull trend?\n\nIt's unlikely. Future stock declines seem to be a certain which means crypto will follow.\n\nNonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months. A handful of breaks above 110k with retreats below isn't bullish, it's bearish.

Forward guidance is very negative with most economist saying a recession is basically unavoidable if we aren't already in one.

Many publicly traded companies have given forward warnings about future quarterly reports.\n\nWhat's next for Crypto?\n\nSame pattern seems to be holding true.

It's a bet that has yet to come true.\n\nCan crypto run into a new bull trend?\n\nIt's unlikely. Future stock declines seem to be a certain which means crypto will follow.\n\nNonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months.

Forward guidance is very negative with most economist saying a recession is basically unavoidable if we aren't already in one.

Many publicly traded companies have given forward warnings about future quarterly reports.\n\nWhat's next for Crypto?\n\nSame pattern seems to be holding true.

It's a bet that has yet to come true.\n\nCan crypto run into a new bull trend?\n\nIt's unlikely. Future stock declines seem to be a certain which means crypto will follow.\n\nNonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months.

Does it hold and rally some into summer.\n\nIt did hold around the low 75k level.\n\nUS economics hasn't changed. Forward guidance is very negative with most economist saying a recession is basically unavoidable if we aren't already in one. The question has moved onto wondering how deep of a recession we'll have. It's more than tariffs, it's consumer expectations are at extreme lows which means consumer spending has been pulling back. Many publicly traded companies have given forward warnings about future quarterly reports.\n\nWhat's next for Crypto?\n\nSame pattern seems to be holding true. If US stocks are heading for a hard dip second half of this year into 2026, then crypto is going with it. Some wonder if BTC will hold this time, as the digital gold rumored asset class? It's a bet that has yet to come true.\n\nCan crypto run into a new bull trend?\n\nIt's unlikely. Future stock declines seem to be a certain which means crypto will follow.\n\nNonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months. A handful of breaks above 110k with retreats below isn't bullish, it's bearish.

Does it hold and rally some into summer.\n\nIt did hold around the low 75k level.\n\nUS economics hasn't changed. Forward guidance is very negative with most economist saying a recession is basically unavoidable if we aren't already in one. The question has moved onto wondering how deep of a recession we'll have. It's more than tariffs, it's consumer expectations are at extreme lows which means consumer spending has been pulling back. Many publicly traded companies have given forward warnings about future quarterly reports.\n\nWhat's next for Crypto?\n\nSame pattern seems to be holding true. If US stocks are heading for a hard dip second half of this year into 2026, then crypto is going with it. Some wonder if BTC will hold this time, as the digital gold rumored asset class? It's a bet that has yet to come true.\n\nCan crypto run into a new bull trend?\n\nIt's unlikely. Future stock declines seem to be a certain which means crypto will follow.\n\nNonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months. A handful of breaks above 110k with retreats below isn't bullish, it's bearish. I personally am not betting on a new crypto bull run anytime soon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vv4xkgk3u70f1.png?width=1686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f935e6b92f89f0ed6a7ac63df5986361968b16e8","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1746996659.000000000}

Forward guidance is very negative with most economist saying a recession is basically unavoidable if we aren't already in one. The question has moved onto wondering how deep of a recession we'll have. It's more than tariffs, it's consumer expectations are at extreme lows which means consumer spending has been pulling back. Many publicly traded companies have given forward warnings about future quarterly reports.\n\nWhat's next for Crypto?\n\nSame pattern seems to be holding true. If US stocks are heading for a hard dip second half of this year into 2026, then crypto is going with it. Some wonder if BTC will hold this time, as the digital gold rumored asset class? It's a bet that has yet to come true.\n\nCan crypto run into a new bull trend?\n\nIt's unlikely. Future stock declines seem to be a certain which means crypto will follow.\n\nNonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months. A handful of breaks above 110k with retreats below isn't bullish, it's bearish. I personally am not betting on a new crypto bull run anytime soon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vv4xkgk3u70f1.png?width=1686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f935e6b92f89f0ed6a7ac63df5986361968b16e8","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1746996659.000000000}

We know what's coming.","selftext":"This isn't financial advice or guidance; make your own decisions and do your own analysis.\n\nOriginal post: ✅ [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h85mvn/always\\_remember\\_we\\_aint\\_sheep\\_we\\_know\\_whats\\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h85mvn/always_remember_we_aint_sheep_we_know_whats_coming/)\n\n2nd Update: ✅\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1iz79rf/update\\_always\\_remember\\_we\\_aint\\_sheep\\_we\\_know/](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1iz79rf/update_always_remember_we_aint_sheep_we_know/)\n\n**Details**:\n\n&gt;Question now? Does it hold and rally some into summer.\n\nIt did hold around the low 75k level.\n\nUS economics hasn't changed. Forward guidance is very negative with most economist saying a recession is basically unavoidable if we aren't already in one. The question has moved onto wondering how deep of a recession we'll have. It's more than tariffs, it's consumer expectations are at extreme lows which means consumer spending has been pulling back. Many publicly traded companies have given forward warnings about future quarterly reports.\n\nWhat's next for Crypto?\n\nSame pattern seems to be holding true. If US stocks are heading for a hard dip second half of this year into 2026, then crypto is going with it. Some wonder if BTC will hold this time, as the digital gold rumored asset class? It's a bet that has yet to come true.\n\nCan crypto run into a new bull trend?\n\nIt's unlikely. Future stock declines seem to be a certain which means crypto will follow.\n\nNonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months. A handful of breaks above 110k with retreats below isn't bullish, it's bearish. I personally am not betting on a new crypto bull run anytime soon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vv4xkgk3u70f1.png?width=1686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f935e6b92f89f0ed6a7ac63df5986361968b16e8","sentimentScore":null,"timestamp":1746996659.000000000}
