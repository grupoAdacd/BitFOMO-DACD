The memecoin market is more oversaturated than it's ever been, and the potential to get returns is lower than it's ever been.\n\nThe illusion has been shattered.\n\nIn 2017, back during the peak of SafeMoon, there was excitement.  People thought they had a genuine chance to make a million dollars by investing $100.  They regularly saw stories about people who made this kind of money, and they thought it could be them.  There was community driven hype surrounding these projects that you could get involved in to join into a cycle that validated what you all hoped to happen.\n\nBut then these people lost money again, and again, and again.

They watched USDC depeg in what looked like it could be D-day for all of crypto.\n\nRetail saw this happen too.  They watched Matt Damon shill them tokens during the superbowl, they bought in, and they got rugged.  Why the hell would these people get interested in crypto again?  The excitement came, they got taken advantage of and duped, and they aren't coming back.  If we wonder why retail isn't interested anymore, it's fucking obvious why.

The rollup centric roadmap is working like a charm and we are watching the network evolve into a high performance global compute layer without compromising security or decentralization.\n\nL2s like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism are not just sidekicks anymore. They are where the real action is happening. Furthermore, the more the infrastructure matures and developers lean into L2 native apps, expect a wave of innovation from hyper efficient DeFi protocols to on chain social platforms that work smoothly.\n\nEthereum is not just growing, it is leveling up and we are witnessing it.

{"id":"1kjdxmx","ts":"2025-05-10T16:14:58Z","ss":"reddit-feeder","subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","author":"aminok","title":"A list of incredible projects in Ethereum","selftext":"Here's a list of incredible projects in Ethereum:\n\nThere's **ZKP2P**, which runs on the Base execution protocol. It allows any web event to be used as an input in a self-executing smart contract. That means a payment on Web2 or a centralized payment system like Venmo or Revolut can be used — trustlessly — to execute a token swap on Ethereum. It's permissionless, it's trust-minimized, and it works by proving fiat payments without exposing any private data. In other words, this becomes an on-ramp that doesn’t require a centralized peer-to-peer fiat-to-crypto platform. It just uses Ethereum.\n\nThe next project I’m very interested in is **Aztec Network**. This is a rollup-based execution protocol that settles to Ethereum and is built from the ground up to allow privacy. Privacy is the biggest missing element right now in the blockchain space, and Aztec has completely committed itself to making it a normal part of blockchain-based finance. It lets developers build smart contracts where inputs and outputs are encrypted by default, using a system they’ve built around their custom AVM and the Noir language. It’s aiming to make privacy programmable, not just bolt it on.\n\nNext up is **Tornado Cash**. Tornado Cash is the most widely adopted privacy protocol in the world. It’s also suffered the most intense state-level attack any protocol has ever faced. The U.S. government actually sanctioned it, adding immutable smart contract addresses to its SDN list. Those sanctions were later struck down in federal court after a long legal fight. Developers were criminally charged under the previous administration, and those charges may now be on the way out under the new Republican administration. But regardless of how the cases unfold, the sheer intensity of the attack shows the potential that Tornado Cash has to disrupt global finance. Ethereum already lets people transact peer-to-peer by default. But when you add privacy, those peer-to-peer payments become usable in any context. You can pay your contractor, your barber, your rent, or your coffee — without exposing sensitive financial history to your counterparty.\n\nThe next one I'm very interested in is **MegaETH**. MegaETH is a totally modular project — really a full execution environment — that uses EigenLayer and EigenDA for its data availability. Validation and consensus are handled by Ethereum, and execution is done on its own high-throughput EVM. By taking the best from every part of the modular stack, it achieves the greatest scalability of any blockchain in history, all while staying fully Ethereum-aligned. Even its off-chain data availability is cryptoeconomically secured via restaked Ether. EigenLayer shows that Ethereum’s modular scaling roadmap isn’t just feasible — it allows for a system that will eventually exceed the scalability of centralized Web2 apps. And it proves that restaked ETH can act as economic glue, aligning off-chain systems with Ethereum’s trust model.\n\nThe next project I’m very excited about is the **ZKVM** being created by RISC Zero using RISC-V. They’re building a system that can prove an entire Ethereum block with a zero-knowledge proof. That means even very lightweight devices will be able to validate full Ethereum blocks without running a full node. That opens the door to Ethereum eventually scaling to 10,000 transactions per second, without compromising hardware accessibility or end-user verifiability.\n\nThen there’s **Base**. Base is right now the leading Ethereum execution protocol. It rolls up on Ethereum using the Optimism stack. It has no token, so it’s fully ETH-aligned, and it’s backed by Coinbase — arguably the most important company in crypto. Base is proving that the Ethereum scaling roadmap is the best in the world, and it’s bringing Ethereum’s magic to the entire world. Coinbase’s laser focus on UX is essential, especially now that scalability bottlenecks have been largely solved with the maturation of the rollup construct.  \n  \nAnd finally, **BlackRock’s BUIDL fund**. This one might be the most institutionally important. BlackRock launched a tokenized fund — on Ethereum. It holds U.S. Treasuries, distributes yield daily, and it already surpassed $1.5 billion in assets. It’s the first time the world’s largest asset manager issued a fund directly on a public blockchain. That’s not just adoption — it’s anchoring traditional finance to Ethereum. And it signals that the Ethereum settlement layer is credible enough for institutions managing trillions. It’s hard to overstate how big that is.\n\nThere are many more Ethereum projects that I am very excited about, but these are the first few that come to mind.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bofr3g0qbzze1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fee33baf5952e6ada3f423565e44447be758b0a","sentimentScore":0.09574468085106383,"timestamp":1746893698.000000000}

Looking for projects with actual traction","selftext":"Real World Assets (RWA) are all over the crypto narrative lately — tokenized bonds, property, invoices, even luxury goods. It’s exciting, but I still feel like we’re in the early innings. A lot of the big names (like Ondo, Maple, etc.) seem solid but still very institution-heavy.\n\nI’m curious if anyone’s seen **actual use cases** getting adopted on the ground — especially in developing or underbanked regions where the benefits of tokenization could be more immediate.\n\nAny projects you’ve come across that are going beyond the usual “wrap a treasury bond” model? Bonus points if they’re live and doing something different with real-world services or infrastructure.\n\nWould love to build a short list of early movers worth watching (or quietly stacking).","sentimentScore":0.2857142857142857,"timestamp":1746849428.000000000}

But I found something completely different: a project called **DualMint** that's tokenizing laundromats.\n\nAt first I thought it was satire, but they’re actually pulling in yield from physical businesses laundromats, vending machines, EV chargers and streaming it as stablecoin rewards.\n\nAPY sits around 20–25% depending on the asset, and it’s paid monthly.\n\nFeels like a weird blend of TradFi fundamentals and onchain mechanics. It’s definitely not your typical DeFi farm or Ponzi.\n\nHas anyone else looked into these “boring” RWA approaches vs the usual institutional real estate/meta-bond stuff?

If the market moves in the opposite direction and you lose about 10% of the position ($100), then your entire margin is depleted — and the platform will liquidate the position to prevent further losses.”\n\nWhat is LEVERAGE?
